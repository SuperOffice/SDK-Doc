Result
======

Your resulting screen should now look like this when used:
![](Show%20recpients%20in%20New%20Request_files/New%20request.png)

As you can see, our screen now shows the recipients on top, no matter which tab is focused. You can now use a screenChooser to override our default screen with your new version (left as an excercise :-)).
