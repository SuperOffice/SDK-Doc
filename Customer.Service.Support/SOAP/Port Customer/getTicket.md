*Description*:

This method is used to retrieve one request (ticket). You are only allowed to see request which has security level external. You have to specify which fields/information (as strings) you want to get for this request. All valid fields are listed below. The fields are returned as an array of *ResultStruct*. In addition all external message id’s are returned for this request. Use **getMessage()** to retrieve information about one specific message.

 

*In Parameters*:

* sessionKey            - A valid session key

* ticketId     - The id of the request to retrieve

* ticketFields           - An array of strings indicating all fields to be retrieved for this request. If you specify an illegal field, it will be ignored. Valid fields are:

o   ticket.id

o   ticket.title

o   ticket.created\_at

o   ticket.category

o   ticket.status

o   ticket.replied\_at

o   ticket.closed\_at

o   ticket.priority

o   ticket.read\_by\_customer

o   ticket.has\_attachment

o   ticket\_last\_changed

 

Extra fields are also valid on the form:

o   ticket.x\_\[extra field id\]

*Out Parameters*:

* errorCode  - See appendix for error codes

* ticketResult           - An array of *ResultStruct* containing all the requested ticket fields. All fields are formatted as strings, so you have to do any conversion yourself. A *ResultStruct* consist of a *field* indicating which ticket fields this is, a *value* indicating the value of the field and a *type* indicating the type of the field. All types are listed in the appendix. Normally the sequence of the ResultStructs will follow the same sequence as specified in the *ticketFields* parameter. The only exception is if you enter an illegal ticket field, this will be skipped, and thus the number of ResultStructs will be less than the number specified in *ticketFields.* You should therefore always check the *field* member to be sure.

* messageIds            An array of integers of all external messages connected to this request.

*Example*:

customer.customerService custService = new customer.customerService();

string sessionKey;

string errorCode = custService.login(“johndoe”,”pw”,out sessionKey);

if(errorCode.Equals(“0”))

    {
       // The fields we want to get
       string\[\] ticketFields = new string\[3\];
       ticketFields\[0\] = "ticket.title";
       ticketFields\[1\] = "ticket.created\_at";
       ticketFields\[2\] = "ticket.category";

 

       // The return values goes here
       customer.ResultStruct\[\] ticketResult;
       string\[\] messageIds;

 

       // Get request 1012

errorCode = custService.getTicket(sessionKey, “1012”, ticketFields, out ticketResult, out messageIds);

 

       if (errorCode.Equals(“0”))
       {
          foreach (string i in messageIds)
            \[Here *i* is running through all message id’s\]

 

          if (ticketFields\[0\].field.Equals(“ticket.title”))
            \[Here ticketFields\[0\].value is the title of the request\]
       }
       else
          string errorMsg = custService.getErrorMessage(sessionKey);
    }

else

    {
       \[Could not login customer\]
    }
