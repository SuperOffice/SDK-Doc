*Description*:

This method will create a new request/ticket with the customer as author of the request. You can set various information about the request. To set any external extra fields, you use an array of **ValuePairStruct**. The field should contain the name of the extra field, which is x\_&lt;nr&gt;, where nr = number of the extra field. User **getExtraFields()** to find this name. The value should contain the value of the extra field (and is always sent as a string). See appendix of data types for formatting. The method returns the id of the newly created request. You use this id to add messages with the **addMessage()** method.

* sLevel        - The security level of the request. 1 = internal, 2 = external

* categoryId - The category id of the request. Only external categories are allowed. Use **getCategory()** to find the id of the category

* priorityId   - The id of the priority for this request. Only external priorities are allowed. Use **getPriorities()** to find the id of the priority. If you want the system to use its internal rules for deciding the priority, specify -1 for this field

* extraField  - An array of **ValuePairStruct** specifying any external extra values you want to set for this request. The field member should contain the name of the extra field, and the value member contain the value/data to set (as a string).

*Example*:

customer.customerService custService = new customer.customerService();

customer.ValuePairStruct\[\] extraFields = new customer.ValuePairStruct\[0\]; //We do not want any extra fields set

 

string errorCode = custService.login(“johndoe”,”pw”,out sessionKey);

if(errorCode.Equals(“0”))

{

       string ticketId;

string retVal = custService.newTicket(sessionKey, "Server error", "2", “23”, "-1", extraFields, out ticketId);

if (retVal.Equals(“0”))
