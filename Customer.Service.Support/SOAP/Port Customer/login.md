*Description*:

This method is used to log in a customer. Almost all the other methods require that the user is logged in. The **login()** method requires the username and password to the customer. If you do not have the password of the customer, you should use **loginAsCustomer()** instead. The **login()** method returns a session key, and this key you have to use for all the other methods to work. The session key identifies the user, and also that it is a valid session. The session key has a idle timeout of  30 minutes, but this can be adjusted in the eJournal database. You should call **logout()** when you are finished with a seesion.
