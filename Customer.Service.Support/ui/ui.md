A guide to interacting with and customizing the SuperOffice UI through CRMScript.

## Screen events and hook scripts

* [Screen events](./screen-events.md) represent steps in the process of loading Service screens.

* *Hook scripts* are event-driven CRMScripts that do stuff at a specific point during loading.

## Extra menus and button scripts

* [Extra menus](./extra-menus.md) let you make something easily available in SuperOffice Service. For example, a button that takes the user directly to a specific screen or a menu option that triggers a script.

* [Button scripts](./button-scripts.md) are CRMScripts that are referenced by their **includeId** and run when the user clicks a custom button.

## Custom screens (bLogic)

**bLogic** is a system for [designing screens](./custom-screens/custom-screens.md) and displaying content in SuperOffice Service.

Custom screens are based on a set of [screen elements](./custom-screens/add-screen-element.md) (controls) such as text, date, grid, and CRMScript.

There are 3 types of screen elements:

* [View elements](./custom-screens/view-elements.md): display info (read-only)
* [Form elements](./custom-screens/form-elements.md): create user interaction with input fields
* [Group elements](./custom-screens/layout-elements.md): create a hierarchy of elements and determine the layout of the screen

These are listed in the [element reference](./blogic-screen-elements/blogic-screen-elements.md).

With scripts, you can:

* process the form data of a screen - for example, to create a request or send an email

* construct and modify a screen that requires a more dynamic layout - for example, to add an element only if the customer is of a specific category

## Screen choosers

[Screen choosers](./screen-choosers.md) are CRMScripts that redirect to a custom screen (or perform other actions before loading a standard screen).

## URL parameters

[URL parameters](./url-parameters.md) let you control SuperOffice Service using simple HTTP commands.

## Web panels

[Web panels](./web-panels.md) let you add webpages inside SuperOffice CRM.

## SOProtocol

[SOProtocol](./so-protocol.md) is a standard for defining URL short-cuts to SuperOffice entities. It lets you control the user interface without scripting and send users directly to the entry in question.

## Classes

* [EventData](./eventdata.md)
* [HtmlElement](./htmlelement.md)
* [MainMenu](./mainmenu.md)
