A base class for representing all other intrinsic datatypes. Any variable can be up-casted to Generic.

There's a close connection between Generic and structs:

* simpler iteration of variables (struct members)
* easier to access and set new variables in structs
* possible to change which variables are members without having to hard-code each field
