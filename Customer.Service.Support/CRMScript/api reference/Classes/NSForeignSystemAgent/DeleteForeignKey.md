Deletes all specified occurrences of a key, belonging to the ForeignApp and ForeignDevice, table and record specified. Specifying a blank table name will delete ALL keys of the given name; specifying a recordId of 0 will delete ALL keys of the given name for the given table.



* **foreignKey:** Key name to delete.
* **applicationName:** The name of the foreign application.
* **deviceName:** The name of the foreign device.
* **deviceIdentifier:** The device identifier. Optional if device identifier is not used.
* **tableName:** Table name, transformed to and from numeric table id by the service layer.\<p/>Use an empty string to delete ALL keys that otherwise match; this may be dangerous and can take a long time if there are many items to delete.
* **recordId:** Id of record that this key refers to. If the table name was blank, then this parameter must be 0. It can also be 0 to mean that the foreign key record was not bound to any particular record of the target table.\<p/>Specifying a zero recordId will remove the recordId restriction and delete all keys that otherwise match.
* **Returns:** This method has no return value
