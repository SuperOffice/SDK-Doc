Map constructor.

This constructor will parse a string of [key] = [value] and insert it into a Map, which will be returned.

The string may look something like this:

```crmscript
String t = 'Foo = bar\nhelpFile = c:\winnt\help.hlp\nsomeStirng = This is a test: 2 + 2 = 4';

or

String t;
t += "Foo = bar\n";
t += "helpFile = c:\winnt\help.hlp\n";
t += "someStirng = This is a test: 2 + 2 = 4";

Map m = Map(t);
```

You need to use "\n" to separate the key-value pairs.

The constructor also supports multiple-line values. For example:

```crmscript
String t = "Foo = this is a value
  which spans several lines,
  and that can be quite
  convenient.";
```

  The first whitespace of a continuing line is deleted.


* **text:** String with names and values
* **Returns:** Map object containing name-value pairs.
