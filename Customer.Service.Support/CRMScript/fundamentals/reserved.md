You should also avoid using:

* the name of HTML objects and event handlers
* the name of built-in CRMScript classes and functions (can't be redefined or used by you)

## Future compatibility

Avoid all standard programming language reserved words.
This can save you from having to re-write your code as CRMScript evolves.
