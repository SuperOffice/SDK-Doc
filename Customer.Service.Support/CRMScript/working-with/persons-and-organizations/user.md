The **User** CRMScript class represents the following entities:

* Real-life: a user account
* SuperOffice UI: user
* Database table: ejuser

> [!NOTE]
> To get from a user object to a customer or company object, you must go via the **associate** table.

## Create and update customers

### Void setValue(String column, String Value)

Sets a named field to the given value. Look up names in the reference section down below, or check out the [class reference](https://community.superoffice.com/documentation/SDK/SO.Customer.Service.Support/html/CRMScript-Classes-User-setValue.htm).

> [!NOTE]
> Both parameters are strings! Remember to use quotes even for IDs. <br>
> You must call `save()` after setting all applicable values to actually create or update the company.

```crmscript
User u;
u.load(9);
u.setValue("email", "bob@example.com");
u.save();
```

### Integer save()

Saves a new or updated user and returns its ID.

* If the ID is set before calling `save()`, it's an update.
* If the ID is empty, it's a create.

```crmscript!
User u;
u.setValue("firstname", "Sam");
printLine(u.save().toString());
```

## Get user info

### Bool load(Integer id)

Brings up the user with the given ID. This is always the 1st step when you want to do anything with an existing user.

```crmscript
User u;
u.load(9);
```

### Bool loadFromAgentAndKey(Integer id, String Key)

Brings up the user that is owned by the agent and matching the external key.

> [!CAUTION]
> `loadFromAgentAndKey()`might overwrite existing values!

### String getValue(String colName)

Fetches the value from a named field. Look up names in the reference section down below.

```crmscript!
User u;
u.load(8);
printLine(u.getValue("firstname"));
```

## Security

### Bool isAdministrator()

Checks whether the user is an administrator.

### Bool isLoggedIn(Integer origin)

Checks if the user is signed to the given endpoint.

* 1 = soap interface
* 2 = web pages

```crmscript
print(u.isLoggedIn(2).toString());
```

### Bool hasTicketAccess(Integer ticketId, Integer accessLevel)

Checks whether the user meets the access level for a ticket.

| Access level | Ticket action |
|:------------:|---------------|
| 0            | List          |
| 1            | Read          |
| 2            | Edit          |

```crmscript
print(u.hasTicketAccess(42,1).toString());
```

## User experience

The **activeuser** table holds info about currently signed-in users. Use it to look up who is signed in, at what location, and so on.

> [!WARN]
> Changing this table **might prevent users from signing in!** Fixing it requires intervention by SuperOffice support. Consider it a read-only table!

## Parser variables

Calling `toParser()` will load fields, prefix them with *user*, and make them available to [templates](xref:crmscript_reply_template).

```crmscript!
Parser p;
User u;
u.load(2);
u.toParser(p);
printLine(p.getVariable("user.username", 0));
```
