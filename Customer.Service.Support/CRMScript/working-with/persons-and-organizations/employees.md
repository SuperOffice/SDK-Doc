The **associate** database table represents employees, resources, and other users - except for external persons.
It is an MDO list item table and has therefore not a corresponding CRMScript class.

Yet, this table is important for understanding and navigating the relationship between a person and their user account as well as the relationship between employees at the organization running the CRM system and the external parties they interact with.

You may think of associates as the missing link that connects people.
