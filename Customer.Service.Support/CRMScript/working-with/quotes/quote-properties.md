Quotes are what connects products to a sale. You must [record a sale](../sales/leads.md) **before** you can add a quote. Also, [products](./products.md) must have been registered before you can add them to a quote.

> [!NOTE]
> Each quote belongs to a single sale. And there's only 1 quote per sale.

## Retrieve quote info

* To view basic info, use `NSQuote`.
* To view (and possibly update) complex info, use `NSQuoteEntity`.

### NSQuote GetQuote(Integer quoteId)

```crmscript
NSQuoteAgent qa;
NSQuote quote = qa.GetQuote(1);
```

### NSQuote GetQuoteFromSaleId(Integer saleId)

```crmscript
NSQuoteAgent qa;
NSQuote quote = qa.GetQuoteFromSaleId(69);
```

### NSQuoteEntity GetQuoteEntity(Integer quoteId)

```crmscript
NSQuoteAgent qa;
NSQuoteEntity quoteEntity = qa.GetQuoteEntity(1);
```

### NSQuoteEntity GetQuoteEntityFromSaleId(Integer saleId)

A variant of `GetQuoteEntity()` that uses a sale ID to find the quote.

## Create quote

You can either create a quote **from scratch or copy** an existing quote from another sale.

### NSQuoteEntity CreateAndSaveQuote(Integer saleId, Integer connectionId, String firstAlternativeName)

```crmscript!
NSQuoteAgent qa;
NSQuoteEntity quote = qa.CreateAndSaveQuote(72,1,"basic gardening supplies");

printLine(quote.GetQuoteId().toString());
```

> [!TIP]
> If there's no external ERP connection, you're most likely using SuperOffice with ID 1.

### NSQuoteEntity CreateAndSaveQuoteFromSale(Integer copyFromSaleId, Integer copyToSaleId)

 The quote is copied with its products and alternatives.

```crmscript!
NSQuoteAgent qa;
NSQuoteEntity quote = qa.CreateAndSaveQuoteFromSale(67,73);

printLine(quote.GetSaleId().toString());
```

> [!NOTE]
> The sale you copy the quote **from** must have the same [currency](../sales/currency.md) as the sale you are copying it **to**.

## Update quote

Updates to a quote mostly target the [alternatives and quote lines](./quote-alternatives.md). You will, however, see some changes to the quote properties when dealing with [quote documents](./quote-document.md) and [placing orders](./quote-order.md).

## Versions

There may be multiple versions of a quote, but only 1 of them is **active** at any time.
Each version will have 1 or more [alternatives](./quote-alternatives.md), which in turn will have 1 or more quote lines.

When updating quotes, you'll always be working on the latest version.

### Find the latest version

```crmscript!
NSQuoteAgent qa;
NSQuote quote = qa.GetQuote(2);
Integer versionNumber = quote.GetActiveQuoteVersionId();

printLine("Active version: " + versionNumber.toString());
```

### NSQuoteVersion GetQuoteVersion(Integer quoteVersionId)

Fetches a specific version.

```crmscript!
NSQuoteAgent qa;
NSQuoteVersion version = qa.GetQuoteVersion(3);

printLine(version.GetExpirationDate().toString());
```

### NSQuoteVersion[] GetQuoteVersions(Integer quoteId)

Fetches all quote versions for a sale.

```crmscript!
NSQuoteAgent qa;
NSQuoteVersion[] versionList = qa.GetQuoteVersions(5);

for(Integer i = 0; i < versionList.length(); i++) {
  printLine(versionList[i].GetRank().toString() + " |\t" + versionList[i].GetState().toString());
}
```

### NSQuoteVersion CreateAndSaveQuoteVersion(Integer quoteVersionId)

Creates a new version based on another version of the same quote. This is your only option when you want to edit a sent quote.

```crmscript
NSQuoteAgent qa;
NSQuoteVersion version = qa.CreateAndSaveQuoteVersion(2);
```

### Update version

This example extends the expiration date by 1 week:

```crmscript
NSQuoteAgent qa;
NSQuoteVersion version = qa.GetQuoteVersion(3);

version.SetExpirationDate(version.GetExpirationDate().addDays(7));

version = qa.SaveQuoteVersion(version);

printLine("New expiration date: " + version.GetExpirationDate().toString());
```

> [!TIP]
> Remember to call `SaveQuoteVersion()` whenever you update a version!

## Delete quote

> [!CAUTION]
> Always check before deleting. There might be legal and/or financial reasons to keep quote info in the system.

```crmscript
Integer quoteId = 13;
NSQuoteAgent qa;
qa.DeleteQuote(quoteId);
```
