SuperOffice has great support for globalization by providing a culture-neutral and language-neutral user interface.

The UI supports localized labels and regional data through the application for users in more than 15 cultures.
It is extendable so you can support other cultures or regions not included by default.

There's also an API to augment string resources throughout the platform.

## Localization

*Localization* is the process of translating an application's resources into localized versions for each culture that the application will support.

Working with [formatted addresses](../working-with/persons-and-organizations/addresses.md) is an example of localized content.
