## When an error occurs

Here are some common mistakes to watch out for:

* Omitting the semicolon at the end of the statement
* Trying to use an undeclared variable or function
* Forgetting to initialize variables
* Using a single equal sign to check equality
* Trying to print something that is not a String and forgetting `.toString()`
* Missing or misplaced parenthesis or curly brace
* Trying to access an uninitialized array index or overstepping array boundaries
* Treating 0-based indexes as if they started on 1
* Creating never-ending loops
