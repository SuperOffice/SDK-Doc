Using the table
===============

We have now created our table, and we can easily search its content and add data to it by choosing "Requests" -&gt; "Tables" in the main menu. You will there find our new table, and you can click the "New entry" icon to the right of it to create a new entry in the table. You will then get a form for creating a new equipment row. As you can see, the form will have controls matching the data types we chose for our fields. Fill out some data and click Ok. You should now be looking at an "Equipment card", showing the fields and the values for one single equipment unit.

You can now create some more entries, and you have your equipment database up and running. Try editing existing entries, cloning entries or deleting entries.
