A resource like meeting room or projector would typically be type = 1

An external associate who may log in via Audience or any Collaborative CRM would be type = 4

Unknown party accessing the system (e.g. prospecting, eCRM) = 7 (no person (1) + not authenticated (2) + no diary(4))

Application with full access rights (EAI) (system user) = 13 (no person (1) + no diary(4) + full access/bypass sentry (8))
