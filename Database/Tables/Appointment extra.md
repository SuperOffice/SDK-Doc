### Values needed to access the appointment tables

This table must contain special values that would be difficult to guess correctly. These are listed below with a description of how to use them.

**Note**: booking means a group reservation where you invite several associates or resources to join.

| Private appointment | 2      | This appointment can only be read by members in my group/dept |

Task\_idx
=========

Is either template\_idx (DocTmpl\_id in DocTmpl) or task\_idx (Task\_id in Task), depending on the type value.

| **Type**                     | **Task\_Idx** | **Status**                             |
|------------------------------|---------------|----------------------------------------|
| Appointment in diary         | task\_idx     | 1 = not started, 2 = started, 3 = done |
| Appointment in check list    | task\_idx     | 1 = not started, 2 = started, 3 = done |
| Booking, made for diary      | task\_idx     | booking (mother\_id &gt; 0)            |
| Booking\_made for check list | task\_idx     | booking (mother\_id &gt; 0)            |
| Note – post it               | -             | -                                      |
| Document in                  | template\_idx | 1 = not started, 2 = started, 3 = done |

Mother\_id 
===========

| **Mother\_id** | **Appointment\_id**                 | **Comment**                                                                             |
|----------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0              |                                     | This is a simple appointment                                                            |
| &gt; 0         | mother\_id = appointment\_id        | This is a booking, and the appointment is the master booking (the one that is inviting) |
| &gt; 0         | mother\_id not like appointment\_id | This is a booking, and the appointment is the slave booking (someone who is invited)    |

Bookings share a single text record. In SuperOffice the person doing the inviting is the only one allowed to change the text of this booking (appointment).
A booking may have associate\_id = 0, if it is an invitation to an external participant; in that case the InvitedPersonId is the person ID of the participant. Person\_id is always the id of the person the meeting is with (not of the person who is invited to it).

FreeBusy
========

| **FreeBusy Type** | **Id** | **Comment**                                     |
|-------------------|--------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Busy              | 0      | This appointment is marked as busy in the diary |
| Free              | 1      | This appointment is marked as free in the diary |

Documents linked to an appointment are linked in the Relations table. There is no special marking in appointment so always check if the active appointment has valid entries in the Relations table. The relationdefinition table holds the reldef\_id for "Link to follow-up", "Link to document" and "Link to sale". Our GUI currently only supports links do documents.

 

### To assign an appointment to someone:

```vb
Dim apt As IAppointment = so.Database.CreateAppointment()
apt.SetDefaults()
apt.Type = 1 ' or 2
apt.Status = 11
apt.AssignedBy = mamagersId
apt.Person = so.Database.GetPerson(11)
apt.Contact = so.Database.GetContact(3)
apt.Project = so.Database.GetProject(4)
apt.Task = so.Database.GetListItem(SOTableId.enTableTask, 1)
apt.Save()
```

### Accepting an appointment:

```vb
Dim apt As IAppointment = so.Database.GetAppointment(120)
apt.AcceptInvitation(EnResponse.enResponseAccept)

 ' set status from 11 to 1
 ' set assignedBy = associate-id (WARNING: This may change in the future)
```
 

Rejecting an appointment

* set status = 13
* set associate-id = assigned-by


To create an invitation to an appointment

* Create a second appointment as copy of first.
* Appnt.Mother\_id = appnt.appnt\_id
* Appnt.invitedPerson = appnt.associate-id's person-id
* Appnt2.Mother\_id = appnt.appnt\_id
* Appnt2.Associate\_id = invited user
* Appnt2.invitedPerson = invited user's
* Appnt2.type = 6 or 7
* Appnt2.status = 5


On the whole it is best to use the functions on the Appointment object to do this sort of thing:

     SoAppointment.AcceptInvitations

     SoAppointment.AddParticipant

     SoAppointment.RemoveParticipant
