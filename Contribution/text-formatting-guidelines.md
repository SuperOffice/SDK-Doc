title: Text formatting guidelines
---

Using bold, italic, and code style for text elements consistently and appropriately improves the
readability and helps to avoid misunderstandings.

## Bold

Use bold for GUI elements, such as menus and names of dialog boxes and input fields.

## Italics

Use italics for introducing new terms and names of files and folders (paths).

## Strike-through

Don't use strike-through.

## Code style

Use code style for:

* Code elements, such as method and property names
* Database table and column names
* SQL commands
* NuGet package names
* URLs (not intended to be clicked)

**Options:**

* Inline code blocks (surrounded by \`)
* Fenced code blocks (surrounded by \`\`\`) spanning multiple lines.

For details, see [How to include code in docs](code-in-docs.md).

## Headings and link text

Don't use italics, bold, or code in headings or link text.

## Keys and keyboard shortcuts

* Capitalize the first letter of key names.
* Don't use italics, bold, or code.
* Use "+" to join keys that are pressed at the same time.
