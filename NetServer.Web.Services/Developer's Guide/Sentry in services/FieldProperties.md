The FieldProperties is the mechanism that is provided by NetServer to check the individual field access rights of the logged in user. All the entities of the service layer will have this property. A typical use of this property is to check the data rights of the user before making a change or before reading a value. We can use this property for many other purposes like to check the data rights and disable a certain button or a disable a read-only field. The examples below demonstrate typical scenarios of the use of this property.

```
using SuperOffice;
using SuperOffice.CRM.Services;
 
using (SoSession mySession = SoSession.Authenticate("sal0", ""))
{
      //get the contact agent
      using(ContactAgent contactAgent = new ContactAgent())
      {
          //retrive the entity you want
          ContactEntity myEntity = contactAgent.GetContactEntity(4);
          //check to see the logged in user have rights to the fields in the
          // form and if not disable the Save button
          if ((!myEntity.FieldProperties["Department"].FieldRight.IsActive) &
    (!myEntity.FieldProperties["Name"].FieldRight.IsActive))
          {
                cmdSave.Enabled = false;
                //we make the fields disable as well using the FieldRight
                //property of the field
                txtDepartment.Enabled =
                myEntity.FieldProperties["department"].FieldRight.IsActive;
                txtName.Enabled =
                myEntity.FieldProperties["Name"].FieldRight.IsActive;
          }
      }
}
```

 

The above code uses the FieldProperties in an indirect way. Here it has been used to check the data rights and if the data rights are not sufficient we have disabled the save button.

```
using SuperOffice;
using SuperOffice.CRM.Services;
 
using (SoSession mySession = SoSession.Authenticate("sal0", ""))
{
      //get the contact agent
      using(ContactAgent contactAgent = new ContactAgent())
      {
          //retrive the entity you want
          ContactEntity myEntity = contactAgent.GetContactEntity(4);
          //check to see the logged in user have rights to the field that you
          //are about to modify
          if (myEntity.FieldProperties["Department"].FieldRight.IsActive)
          {
              //change the department
              myEntity.Department = "Sales";
              //save the entity
              contactAgent.SaveContactEntity(myEntity);
          }
          else
          {
              MessageBox.Show("you dont have the rights to perform this task.
              The reason is " +
              myEntity.FieldProperties["Department"].FieldRight.Reason);  
          }
      }
}
```

 

Here we have used FieldProperties for a more conventional purpose that is to check the data right. If it is not sufficient we do not let the user do the modifications but we show him an error message describing why he cannot do so. Note that we have used the Reason property of the FieldRight property to give the user a more descriptive error. The reason property will have a reason if the user does not have the full permission (Read, Create, Update and Delete) however if the user has full permission the reason property will be blank.

We can use several properties proved by the FieldRight property to check for rights. The most commonly used once are listed below.

IsActive – this property tells us whether this field is active for the logged in user. In other words does the user have the right to this field.

 HasAll – this will tell us whether the user has all the rights to the field.

HasNone – this property will return true is the user does have any rights to the field.

IsMandatory – this property will tell us if this field is mandatory in the database.

IsUiMandatory – this property will tell us if this field is mandatory in the UI.

Mask – using this property we can check whether a certain field right is available for the user. Below is a small example on how to use this property.

```
//check whether the user has the rights
if (myEntity.FieldProperties["Name"].FieldRight.HasAll)
{
//some code here
}
else
{
//some code here               
}
```

 

Reason – this is property will let us retrieve the reason why a given user can not access the field.
