##SuperOffice Online and SuperId

SuperOffice Online does not support username + password authentication for its WebAPI.

All access to the WebAPI happens on behalf of an application with a specific id or application token, and on behalf of a specific user with a ticket or access token.



## Register an Application

You need to [Fill out a form](https://community.superoffice.com/en/crm-online/partners-and-app-store/custom-apps/register-a-custom-app/) to register your application, which includes an official callback URL.

Once registered, you will receive two tokens:

* Application id - a public id you can embed in web pages: `4e5e6f90f529fede129bd25ad`
* Application token - a secret id you should not embed in web pages. `74252df1e0119f1913f64c6d8d`





## OAuth Authorization Code Flow

In the Authorization code flow, an end user accesses a client application that requires the user to authenticate. After clicking login, the partner application redirects the user agent, typically a browser, to the authorization endpoint of the Identity Provider.

![1547210196744](oauth-code-flow.png)



### Start the authorize code flow

The user agent makes a request to the Identity Provider authorization URI with the following information:

```http
GET https://sod.superoffice.com/login/common/oauth/authorize?
  client_id=c789b7d98f3c496fb5aaa4b1a81ca11b&
  scope=openid&
  redirect_uri=https://partnerapp/callback&
  state=12345&
  response_type=code&
```

| Parameter     | Description                                                  |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| client_id     | **Required.** The Application Id assigned to your app when you registered it with SuperOffice. |
| scope         | **Required.** Must be `openid`.                              |
| redirect_uri  | **Required.** The redirect_uri of your app, where authentication responses are sent and received by your app. <br/>It *must* exactly match one of the redirect_uris registered with SuperOffice. |
| state         | **Recommended.** A value included in the request that is also returned in the token response. |
| response_type | **Required.** Must include `code` for the authorization code flow. |
| response_mode | **Optional.** Can be `fragment` and returns parameters in URI after hash #,or `form_data` and returns values in form data. |

The user is then directed to the authentication server login screen, where they enter their credentials. An Identity Provider authenticates the user and asks for consent to access their resources on behalf of the Relying Party.

```http!
GET https://sod.superoffice.com/login/common/oauth/authorize?client_id=c789b7d98f3c496fb5aaa4b1a81ca11b&scope=openid&redirect_uri=http://localhost/DevNet-MvcIntegrationServerApp/callback&state=12345&response_type=code
Accept: application/json
```



### SuperId Redirects to app

With consent given by the user, the SuperId server sends an authorization response message from its authorization endpoint. This redirects the user agent back to the relying party using the redirection URI provided earlier. This URI includes an authorization code and any state provided by the client earlier.

```http
GET https://localhost/DevNet-MvcIntegrationServerApp/callback?
  state=12345&
  code=o0NWI5leHdUflrjlTVVKqbSOt3n9Od0ZrBUq0nXFWKszyOdOZchk60fTf4pDWTFT
```

| Parameter | Description                                                  |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| code      | The authorization code generated by the,authorization server. The authorization code expires after 10 minutes. |
| state     | The exact value received from the client.                    |



### App requests access token from SuperId

The app (the relying party) then makes a request for an ID token to the token endpoint by sending the client ID, client secret, the Authorization code, the redirect URI and the Grant Type to SuperId (the authentication service).

```http
POST https://sod.superoffice.com/login/common/oauth/tokens?
  client_id=c789b7d98f3c496fb5aaa4b1a81ca11b&
  client_secret=83d0f3bcb9afbc7eb9d0682e9b86db52&
  code=o0NWI5leHdUflrjlTVVKqbSOt3n9Od0ZrBUq0nXFWKszyOdOZchk60fTf4pDWTFT&
  redirect_uri=http://localhost/DevNet-MvcIntegrationServerApp/callback&
  grant_type=authorization_code&
```

| Parameter     | Description                                                  |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| client_id     | **Required.** The Application Id assigned to your app when you registered it with SuperOffice. |
| client_secret | **Required.** The Application Token assigned to your app when you registered it with SuperOffice. |
| code          | **Required.** The authorization code that the application requested. The application can use the authorization code to request an access token for the target resource. |
| redirect_uri  | **Required.** The redirect_uri of your app, where authentication responses are sent and received by your app. It must exactly match one of the redirect_uris registered with SuperOffice. |
| grant_type    | **Required.** Must be `authorization_code` for the authorization code flow. |

SuperId (the Identity provider) authenticates the client using the client ID and secret, and validates the redirect URI. When the grant type is set to authorization_code, the identity provider will validate the code parameter. Alternatively, the grant_type is set to refresh_token and the provider will validate the refresh_token parameter.

If valid, the Identity Provider responds back with the ID token from the token endpoint. The response also includes an access token and an optional refresh token. The client validates the ID token, and if successful, the identity is proven and the Authorization Code flow is complete.

```http!
POST https://sod.superoffice.com/login/common/oauth/tokens?client_id=c789b7d98f3c496fb5aaa4b1a81ca11b&client_secret=83d0f3bcb9afbc7eb9d0682e9b86db52&code=o0NWI5leHdUflrjlTVVKqbSOt3n9Od0ZrBUq0nXFWKszyOdOZchk60fTf4pDWTFT&redirect_uri=http://localhost/DevNet-MvcIntegrationServerApp/callback&grant_type=authorization_code
Content-Type: application/json

}
```

| Parameter     | Description                                                  |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| access_token  | The access token issued by the authorization server.         |
| token_type    | Provides the client with the information required to successfully utilize the access token to make a protected resource request. |
| expires_in    | The lifetime in seconds of the access token.                 |
| refresh_token | The refresh token which can be used to obtain new access tokens. The refresh token is a long lived token that can be re-used. It is coupled to an end-users consent and is valid as long as the application authorization record (consent) exists. Tenants can revoke authorizations. |
| id_token      | JSON Web Token (JWT), which consists of a Header, Payload and Signature. The claims in the token form part of the payload. This can be used to verify that the tokens came from the real SuperId server. |

This gives you the access token directly, as well as the refresh token (which is used to get more access tokens), and the JWT.

You will want to keep the refresh_token and access_token if the JWT is valid.



### Verify the JWT

To verify the JWT you need to use a PKCS certificate (there is one per environment)

The ID Token is encoded as a JSON Web Token or JWT, which consists of a Header, Payload and Signature. These elements are delimited by a period. The claims in the token form part of the payload.

![JWT Claims](jwt.png)

The actual verification involves cryptography, and you are best off using a library like .net [System.IdentityModel.Tokens.Jwt](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.IdentityModel.Tokens.Jwt/) or Node [jsonwebtoken](https://github.com/auth0/node-jsonwebtoken). See https://jwt.io/ for a bigger list of libraries.

Here is some Node/Javascript code that does the verification:

```javascript
request(`https://sod.superoffice.com/login/common/oauth/tokens`, {
    method: 'POST',
    body: {
      code: inputData.code,
      client_id: process.env.CLIENT_ID,
      client_secret: process.env.CLIENT_SECRET,
      grant_type: 'authorization_code',
      redirect_uri: process.env.REDIRECT_URL
    },
    headers: {
      'content-type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded',
      'accept': 'application/json'
    }
}).then( response => {
    const result = JSON.parse(response.content);
    const options = { };
    const cert = "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n"+
      "MIIDqzCCApMCAQgwDQYJKoZIhvcNAQEFBQAwgZMxCzAJBgNVBAYTAk5PMQ0wCwYD\n"++++...;
    const jwt_token = jwt.verify(result.id_token, cert, options);    
})
```

The verify call will throw an error if the `id_token` is not signed by the certificate.



### Call the WebAPI with access token

You can now make a request to the WebAPI using the access token:

```http
GET /api/v1/contact/2
Authorization: Bearer 8A:Cust12020.AR2s3phb0gXK8DP0NfoYlsrQAQAACIJ/KQ+cbGp-0l9g8PJNlBCEZxS/1hL3Cxt8ITWlQipRbdknTbIFxUuUChHj4U1qUlP6/dJA+aKE1psfT8F4Xw-FlYBjvw6xmM086Vckm0Mmh+fEPuoLspl+EgtQzD0F8Ka4qLFGWICvUg==
Accept: application/json
```

This access token contains your application's identity and the user's identity.

You should get a valid response back.

```json
{
    "TableRight": {
        "Mask": "RI, RestrictedUpdate",
        "Reason": "[SR_ACCESS_ASSOCCONT_DELETE]"
    },
    "FieldProperties": { ... },
    "ContactId": 2,
    "Name": "statezerodatabase",
    "Department": "",
    "OrgNr": "",
    "Number1": "",
    "Number2": "",
    "UpdatedDate": "2016-01-04T13:27:28",
    "CreatedDate": "2002-07-23T15:14:29",
    "Emails": [],
```



## Expired Access Tokens

If the access token has expired, you will get a HTTP 401 error back (unauthorized).

You will need to use the refresh token to get a new access token. With the new access token you can re-try the request.

A user's refresh_token is valid for the lifetime of the application, or until it has been revoked. A refresh_token is used in a POST request to generate a new access token as follows:

```http
POST https://sod.superoffice.com/login/common/oauth/tokens?
grant_type=refresh_token&
client_id=4ref5376616343b38d14ddcd804f2654&
client_secret=18f45229e442772a78df5f554e24a456&
refresh_token=nKHwerkjh34Yd6QShsnGKk4cFhTwCv3XtJu9PW2X63MtUMygLdI57BJjwCU0&
redirect_url=http://partnerapp/callback
```

 

| Parameter     | Description                                                  |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| grant_type    | **Required.** Must be set to `refresh_token`                 |
| client_id     | **Required.** The Application Id assigned to your app when you registered it with SuperOffice. |
| client_secret | **Required.**The Application Secret assigned to your app when you registered it with SuperOffice. |
| refresh_token | **Required.** The refresh token issued as one of the response items in the Authorization Code Flow. |
| redirect_uri  | **Optional.** The redirect_uri of your app, where authentication responses are sent and received by your app. It must exactly match one of the redirect_uris registered with SuperOffice. |
| scope         | **Optional.** SuperOffice only supports the scope 'openid', and is implicit for each flow. |

 

The response contains the token type, access token, expiration in seconds and identity token.
