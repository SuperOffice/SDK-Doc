# Webhooks Reference

See the @webhook_overview for details on how to register and use the webhooks.

This section describes the events and how they appear when events are dispatched to your
webhook receiver.

# Register a webhook

To register a webhook: ****

``` json
POST /api/v1/Webhook
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "Name": "Tonys Contact Handler",
  "Events": [
        "contact.created",
        "contact.changed",
        "contact.deleted"
    ],
  "TargetUrl": "https://www.myserver.com/superoffice/webhookhandler",
  "Secret": "Something Super Secret",
  "State": "Active",
  "Type": "webhook"
}
```

This will register the webhook, and check that the `TargetUrl` responds to a test POST.

When the event(s) happen (`contact.changed` for example), then the Target URL is notified by HTTP POST using a message like the one described here:

```json
{
  "EventId": "8337ae4a-1dd6-40fd-8dc7-a050664a0af7",
  "Timestamp": "2018-04-24T07:50:50.6812131Z",
  "Changes": [
    "contact_id",
    "associate_id",
    "department",
    "updated_associate_id",
    "updated",
    "updatedCount"
  ],
  "Event": "contact.changed",
  "PrimaryKey": 994863,
  "Entity": "contact",
  "ContextIdentifier": "Cust1234",
  "ChangedByAssociateId": 316,
  "WebhookName":"Name you provided"
}
```

## CrmScript hooks

Webhooks can also target CrmScripts by using the `Type: "crmscript"`. See @webhooks_crmscript for details.
