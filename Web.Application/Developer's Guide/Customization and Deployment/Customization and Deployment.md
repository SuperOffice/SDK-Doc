# Web Client Customizations

Customizing the web client is all made possible by modifying application XML SuperOffice Markup Language (SOML) files. To begin, it's as easy as navigating to the applications App_Data folder and opening one of the .config files that requires customizing. From click-actions to UI windows there are virtually limitless client customization capabilities.

With regards to modifying existing application files, there are downsides to this approach. Product upgrades, for example, replaces all existing files and thereby wipe away all direct customizations.

Client configuration options provide a better approach, with an ability to define a directory outside the installation directory where configuration overrides are placed. These override files are then discovered and incorporated at runtime. The *client configuration provider* solves this problem.

## Client Configuration Provider

Configuration options, located in the web.config file, are declared in the **ClientConfigurationProvider** element and tell the client where additional configuration files are located. This table lists all ClientConfigurationProvider options.

|Options                | Description                                                 |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
|CustomPath             | Defines a path that contains configuration and merge files. |
|CacheConfigurations    | Determines if configuration is cached.                       |
|ValidateConfigurations | Determines of GUI config data is validated at runtime.      |

### Custom Path

To begin, add a **CustomPath** directive in the ClientConfigurationProvider element. The custom path key name must start with the text **CustomPath** and can be suffixed when necessary to support multiple custom paths. The only requirement is each key must start with _CustomPath_ and be unique.

```xml

<SuperOffice>
    ...
    <ClientConfigurationProvider>

     <!-- add path to customization files -->
      <add key ="CustomPath_Common" value ="C:\WebClient\Common" />
      <add key ="CustomPath_Feature" value ="C:\WebFeature\MyFiles" />
      <add key ="CustomPath_ThirdParty" value ="C:\Thirdparty\MyFiles" />

    </ClientConfigurationProvider>
    ...
<SuperOffice>

```

Multiple custom paths are a means to organize and separate features and third-party integrations.

Files in a custom path folder take precedence and override standard web-client configuration files. This means that if a file called **SoApplicationConfiguration.config** exists in a CustomPath, it will take priority and be used instead of the default **SoApplicationConfiguration.config** in the web applications installation folder.

 Inside the custom path directory, there must be structured set of folders following the convention:

`<CustomPath>\[applicationname]\[instancename]\`

Where __applicationname__ and __instancename__ defaults are WebClient and Web, which may or may not be explicitly defined in the **Client** element.

```xml
<SuperOffice>
    ...
    <Client applicationname="WebClient" instancename="Web">
    ...
    </Client>
    ...
</SuperOffice>
```

This default application configuration folder _App_Data_ has the same structure and is where all standard configuration files are installed. The *.config files in these folders make up the entire structure of the web client.

![Web Client Configuration Folder](Customization%20and%20Deployment%20article_files/web-client-configuration-file-folders.png)

With regards to **CustomPath** subfolders, inside the WebClient\Web folders, the structure is not important. Because all subfolders are searched for configuration files, it's really personal-preference.

The following approaches demonstrate a few possibilities.

Approach #1:

```text
C:\WebClient\Common\WebClient\Web\SoApplicationConfiguration.config
C:\WebClient\Common\WebClient\Web\SoArchiveLists.merge
C:\WebClient\Common\WebClient\Web\SoMenuConfiguration.config
```

Approach #2:

```text
C:\WebFeature\MyFiles\WebClient\Web\Inventory\SoCustomInventoryPage.config
C:\WebFeature\MyFiles\WebClient\Web\Inventory\SoCustomInventoryDialog.config
C:\WebFeature\MyFiles\WebClient\Web\Inventory\SoCustomInventoryMenus.merge
```

Approach #3:

```text
C:\Thirdparty\MyFiles\WebClient\Web\Pages\SoThirdPartyPage.config
C:\Thirdparty\MyFiles\WebClient\Web\Pages\SoCustomContactPage.merge
C:\Thirdparty\MyFiles\WebClient\Web\Dialogs\SoThirdPartyDialogPage.config
C:\Thirdparty\MyFiles\WebClient\Web\Scripts\CustomScripts.js
```

With regards to system files, if the decision is to use a copy of the original file in a custom path, try to use one common folder that is shared among third-parties to ensure one does not override the settings of another. That said, it's recommended to use a merge file instead.

Merge files are a means to apply customizations by, not overriding an entire file but, specifying where in an existing file a merge action is applied at runtime. There is more information about merge actions in the merge section below.

### CacheConfigurations

There is a performance benefit to enabling CacheConfigurations, however, it makes more sense to turn this feature off during development. When set to false, configuration changes to UI elements are immediately applied and observed in the browser - there's no need to perform an IIS reset or issue a _flush_ SoProtocol. There are however a few exceptions to this rule.

Caching works for all configuration files except system files. System files are cached during application startup and held in memory. Any changes to the files below do require an IIS reset.

- SoApplicationConfiguration.config
- SoAdminApplicationConfiguration.config
- SoFilterList.config
- SoObjectMapping.config
- SoArchiveColumnList.config
- SoArchiveControlLinkInfoTypes.config
- SoArchiveCriteriaList.config

#### Archive Column Lists

A quick note about **archive** elements. Once an archive provider is initialized with column definitions in an _archive_ element, the column definitions are persisted like preferences in the _SUPERLISTCOLUMNSIZE_ table of the database. Any changes to the _archive_ configuration will not be observed in the client until the corresponding records in the database are purged. To delete rows from the _SUPERLISTCOLUMNSIZE_ table, use the _Archive_ attribute guiname value as the key with the following delete query.

```sql
-- replace [guiname] with the real archive guiname
DELETE * FROM [CRM7].[DATABASENAME].[SUPERLISTCOLUMNSIZE]
WHERE listOwner = '[guiname]'
```

### ValidateConfigurations

SOML is XML that must conform to a well-defined schema. When set to true, **ValidateConfirations** will validate all configurations based on respective schemas to ensure all markup is well-formed. Any errors found are shown in the browser.

## Configuration Lifecycle

While navigating around in the client, incoming requests sent to the server are interpreted and rewritten into a SoProtocol URL. An HttpModule, called SoProtocolModule, parses the SoProtocol string and uses it to determine what to display on the page and what data to load into the page.

To reduce the response payload and enforce things such as user-rights, SoProtocolModule uses the page framework to build the entire page configuration. Then based on the users context, the configuration is then parsed multiple times by various filters to strip away unchanged or unnecessary parts of the page. The build process happens in several steps:

1. Fragments are resolved.
2. Data driven configuration, such as WWW panels, are generated.
3. Merge-filter processes merge files.
4. Caching is performed.
5. All other filters

The following illustration shows how the configuration grows and then shrinks from this process.

![web client config file lifecycle](Customization%20and%20Deployment%20article_files/web-client-merge-file-process.png)

## Merge Process

While the system supports modifying configuration files copied directly from the application into a custom path folder, it's generally cleaner to instead use merge files instead.

Merge files have a .merge file extension and make it easy to add, remove or replace configuration elements without touching the original application files.

Regardless of approach, it's important to know how to target a specific location in a configuration file so that the customization appears in the application where it is expected.

Different elements tags use one or more attributes to ensure each element with the same tag has a unique identity. Having a unique element identity is important to resolve which element is affected. The following table maps which element relies on which identifier(s) to ensure uniqueness.

| Parent | Element | Identifier | File(s)
|------|------------|------|----|
|pages**|page|id|SoApplicationConfiguration|
|currents|current|id|SoApplicationConfiguration|
|jsincludes|jsinclude|path|SoApplicationConfiguration|
|cssincludes|cssinclude|path|SoApplicationConfiguration|
|consts|const|id|SoApplicationConfiguration|
|pages|page|id|So[_abc_]Page|
|archives|archive|providername, guiname|SoArchiveColumnList|
|linkinfos|linkinfo|type, subtype|SoArchiveControlLinkInfoTypes|
|filters**|filter|name|SoFilterList|
|menus**|menu|context, subcontext|SoMenuConfiguration|
|objects|object|mappingname|SoObjectMapping|

** Elements type appear in more than one configuration files.

### Merge Actions

A **mergeaction** attribute is used to determine which element to process. The following table lists what actions are available. *Insert is the default behavior* when no **mergeaction** attribute is specified.

|command|description |
|-------|------------|
|insert | inserts the section (default) |
|replace| replaces the section with same id-value|
|remove | removes the section.|

The following snippet demonstrates how to add a new page to the application configuration pages collection using an _SoApplicationConfiguration.merge_ file.

```xml
<applicationsettings>
  <pages>
    <page id="CustomPage" type="mainpage" mergeaction="insert"/>
  </pages>
</applicationsettings>
```

Not all elements are based on id alone, so remember to use the correct element/identifier when applying changes.

## Page Configuration Files

While element placement might not be important for system configuration files, modifying elements in a page or dialog must be structured accordingly. A page contains cards, and cards contain views, and views contain controlgroups and so on, and knowing how to structure a merge definition is critical to successfully deploying a change.

There are two approaches to apply a configuration change: complete structure or using an xpath element. System files must use the complete structure approach, whole UI pages can use either one or both.

### Complete Structure Approach

Using the complete structure approach means creating a merge file with the complete page structure up to the element with a mergeaction attribute. Using this approach, the merge filter can accurately determine which element to process.

The following example demonstrates how to replace a controlgroup in the SoContactPage configuration. Take notice how each id along the path is defined for the page, panel, card, view, and finally the controlgroup. Make sure to also include the **< pages >** root element.

```xml
<!-- SoContactPage.merge -->
<pages>
  <page id ="ContactPage">
    <panels>
      <panel id="Contact">
        <cards>
          <card id="ContactMainCard">
            <views>
              <view id="MainView">
                <controlgroups>
                  <controlgroup id="maingroup_2" mergeaction="replace"
                                type="SoControlGroup" position="absolute"
                                top="58px" width="42%" right="20px"
                                overflow="hidden">
                    <controls>
                      <control id="miniImage" type="SoImage">
                        <config>
                          <imagetype>url<imagetype>
                          <src>MyImages/WebClient/Web/image/owl.jpg<src>
                        <config>
                      <control>
                    <controls>
                  <controlgroup>
                <controlgroups>
              <view>
            <views>
          <card>
        <cards>
      <panel>
    <panels>
  <page>
<pages>
```

Without stating id values at each stage of the structure, the filter would not be unable to determine which page>panel>card>view>controlgroup path to replace and the merge would be ignored.

### XPath Element Approach

Added in SuperOffice 8.1, xpath is a new approach to add page elements. This approach even supports adding elements across fragments!

_This capability only applies to the contents of UI pages and dialogs and **is not applicable to system files**._

```xml
<!-- Example: <filename>.merge                     
  Add a button to all pages that uses the navigationpanel fragment
 -->
<pages>
  <xpath xpath="/page/panels/panel/cards/card/views/view[@id='NavigatorView']/controlgroups/controlgroup[@id='ButtonGroup']/controls">
    <control  id="testButton" type="SoNavigatorButton">
     ...
    </control>
  </xpath>
</pages>
```

Because pages can contain duplicate element ids at various nested levels, care must be taken when using this approach to ensure no unusual side effects occur.

_The potential for xpath side effects was enough to deem this capability too powerful for replace and remove actions._

## System Configuration Files

System configuration files declare every application dependency, including web controls, currents, menu items and pages. These files essentially describe the skeleton of the entire web application.

This section includes merge file examples for a few system configuration files.

### SoApplicationConfiguration

This file can contain declarations for:

- pages and dialogs
- currents
- consts
- jsincludes
- cssincludes

Do this by creating a new file names MyApplicationConfiguration.merge and place it in your custom path directory. The following is an example that demonstrates how to add a page.

```xml
<applicationsettings>
  <pages>
    <!-- new feature !!! -->
    <page id="customfeature" type="mainpage" />
  </pages>
  <currents>
    <!-- new current !!! -->
    <current id="customfeature" type="none" providername="SoProtocolProvider" />
  </currents>
  <jsincludes>
    <!-- new feature script dependency !!! -->
    <jsinclude path="~/scripts/customfeature.js" />
  </jsincludes>
  <cssincludes>
    <!-- new feature styles dependency !!! -->
    <cssinclude path="~/styles/customfeature.css" />
  </cssincludes>
</applicationsettings>
```

When the application starts your elements are merged into the memory representation of **ApplicationConfiguration.config** and you are good to go.

Assuming the SoCustomFeature.config page exists, it can be called using SoProtocol:

```javascript

PageUpdate('soprotocol:CustomFeature','');

```

A global SuperOffice method PageUpdate issues an SoProtocol string to the server. As stated earlier in this page, in addition to navigation and changing the viewed configuration, SoProtocol also updates currents. Get current's using SuperOffice.Util.getCurrentId.

```javascript
// JavaScript.
var id = 10;
PageUpdate('soprotocol:?customfeature_id=' + id,'');
//or use SuperOffice.PageBuilder
SuperOffice.PageBuilder.setCurrent("customfeature", id);

// get current id value
id = SuperOffice.Util.getCurrentId("customfeature");
```

### SoObjectMapping

SoObjectMapping maps element types used in page configuration files to actual object types defined in assemblies, such as user and web controls.

The excerpt below declares an SoPanel type in **SoObjectMapping.config**. It states that the class _Panel_ in the _SuperOffice.CRM.Web.UI.Controls_ namespace, located in the _SuperOffice.CRMWeb_ assembly is references by **mappingname** SoPanel.

Below that the application declares an SoNavigatorButton type. It states that a class _SoNavigatorButton_ in the _SuperOffice.CRM.Web.UI.Controls_ namespace, located in the _SuperOffice.CRMWeb_ assembly is references by **mappingname** SoNavigatorButton.

```xml
<!-- SoObjectMapping.config -->
<objects>
    <object
        type="IPanel"
        mappingname="SoPanel"
        assemblyname="SuperOffice.CRMWeb"
        objectname="SuperOffice.CRM.Web.UI.Controls.Panel" />
    <object
        type="Control"
        mappingname="SoNavigatorButton"
        assemblyname="SuperOffice.CRMWeb"
        objectname="SuperOffice.CRM.Web.UI.Controls.SoNavigatorButton" />
</objects>
```

Looking in the SoNavigatorPanel.config, the contents of which define all the navigator controls on the left side of SuperOffice, is where the panel type is links to the object mappingname, **SoPanel**. Additionally, nested deep in a card, view, controlgroup and controls element is where the SoNavigatorButton types that represent all the buttons located.

```xml
<!-- SoNavigatorPanel.config -->
<panel id="Navigator" type="SoPanel" paneltype="Navigator" ...>
...
    <control id="dashboardButton" type="SoNavigatorButton" >
    ...
    </control>
    ...
</panel>
```

Below an example demonstrates how to add a new textbox control using an SoObjectMapping.merge file:

```xml
<objects>
    <object
        type="Control"
        mappingname="MySoTextBox"
        assemblyname="CustomFeatures"
        objectname ="CustomFeatures.MySoTextBox" />
</objects >
```

Here is another example that demonstrates how to override the standard web client textbox control:

```xml
<objects>
    <object
        mergeaction="replace"
        type="Control"
        mappingname="SoTextBox"
        assemblyname="CustomFeatures"
        objectname ="CustomFeatures.MySoTextBox"/>
</objects>
```

### SoArchiveControlLinkInfoTypes

Web client data grid controls are called archive controls, and  archive control data sources are called archive providers. Each row has a LinkHints property that is used to construct actual hyperlinks that control what happens when a user clicks a row in the archive control.

The SoArchiveLinkInfoTypes.config file contains all definitions that resolve archive control click actions to executable actions. It's where all custom archive control must add their own linkhint handlers, or **linkinfo** elements, as well.

All linkinfo elements are uniquely identified by a combination of their attributes _type_ and _subtype_. The following is the actual linkinfo that defines what happens when a user clicks on a person row; it issues an SoProtocol that updates the current person id to the selected person.

```xml
<!-- SoArchiveLinkInfoTypes.config -->
<linkinfos>
  <linkinfo type="personarchive:person" subtype="click">
    <baseurl>javascript:PageUpdate('soprotocol:?person_id={person_id}','');</baseurl>
    <target></target>
  </linkinfo>
</linkinfos>
```

Below is an example that demonstrates how to add a click handler, or linkinfo, that is linked to an archive control that exists on the _customfeature_ page. It does the same thing so as to have a uniform behavior throughout the client application. The only difference is the type value prefix, a linkhint-prefix, which is explained in detail in the [Archive Control Row Client](/crm-client-web/web-common/web-archive-row-click-action.md) documentation.

```xml
<!-- SoArchiveLinkInfoTypes.merge -->
<linkinfos>
  <linkinfo type="customfeature:person" subtype="click">
    <baseurl>javascript:PageUpdate('soprotocol:?person_id={person_id}','');</baseurl>
    <target></target>
  </linkinfo>
</linkinfos>
```
