Logging is done using the Util.LogDebugInfo method.

```
    using SuperOffice.Mail;
    
    Util.LogDebugInfo("Setting something up");
    // work work work
    Util.LogDebugInfo("finished...");
```

This method checks the **EnableDebugInfo** preference in the registry. The key is determined by the RegKeyName property. This is usually set for you - but you may need to manually set it if you are not using the MailArchiveHelper.

The log file is always named "SuperOffice.Mail.ArchiveHelper.log" and it is always placed in the folder `user-profile\AppData\SuperOffice`.

The location of AppData varies depending on the Windows version.
