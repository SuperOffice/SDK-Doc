A property, which is of Row type, directly refers to a particular row of a table. For example in the Sale Entity the Currency property would refer to the Currency table and would contain the columns that are in the Currency Table as its properties. The following example explains how to retrieve the properties of a Currency Row through a Sale Entity.

```
using SuperOffice;
using SuperOffice.CRM.Entities;
using SuperOffice.CRM.Rows;
 
using(SoSession mySession = SoSession.Authenticate("SAL0", ""))
{
   //Retrieving an Entity
   Sale newSale = Sale.GetFromIdxSaleId(2);
 
   //Retrieving Properties of a Row through an Entity    
   string saleCurname = newSale.Currency.Name;
   if (newSale.Currency.Deleted == 0)
   {
       string saleCurAct = "Sale Currency Active";
   }
   else
   {
       string saleCurInAct = "Sale Currency is deleted";
   }
 
   string saleCurDB = newSale.Currency.CurrencyTableInfo.DbName;
   string saleCurRate = newSale.Currency.Rate.ToString();
   string saleCurRank = newSale.Currency.Rank.ToString();
   string saleCurRegDate = newSale.Currency.Registered.ToString();
   string saleCurUnits = newSale.Currency.Units.ToString();
}
```

 

Here we have retrieved the properties of the currency Row of the currency table through a Sale Entity.
